## 🔍 How It Works Now

### When Screening an Individual:

2. ✅ Searches UN Consolidated List (real data)
3. ✅ Searches EU Sanctions List (real data)
4. ⏳ Searches PEP database (mock for now)
5. ✅ Calculates risk score (0-100)
6. ✅ Assigns risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)

### When Screening a UK Company:
1. ✅ Verifies with Companies House API (LIVE)
2. ✅ Checks company status (active/dissolved)
3. ✅ Checks for insolvency history
4. ✅ Checks for charges/mortgages
5. ✅ Retrieves all directors
6. ✅ Screens each director against sanctions lists
7. ✅ Detects red flags:
   - Newly incorporated (< 6 months)
   - Insolvency history
   - Charges registered
   - Non-active status
   - Missing officers
