# üéØ Day 10 Plan - PDF Reports & Certificate Integration

## Overview
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Day**: 10 of 40 (25% complete)  
**Focus**: PDF Report Generation & Certificate-Assessment Integration  
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours  
**AI Assistance**: 70%

## Morning Session (4 hours) - PDF Report Generation

### Objective
Generate professional, tribunal-ready PDF reports from Repairing Standard assessments.

### Tasks

#### 1. Setup PDF Library (30 minutes)
```bash
npm install @react-pdf/renderer
npm install --save-dev @types/react-pdf
```

#### 2. Create PDF Template Component (2 hours)
**File**: `src/components/repairing-standard/TribunalReport.tsx`

**Sections to Include**:
- Cover page with ScotComply branding
- Property details (address, landlord info)
- Assessment summary (date, overall score, status)
- Executive summary (key findings)
- 21-point checklist breakdown by category
  - Each checkpoint with status badge
  - Non-compliant items highlighted
  - Evidence photos embedded
  - Notes and observations
- Contractor information (for repairs)
- Cost breakdown (total repair costs)
- Timeline (when issues found, repair dates)
- Compliance score visualization
- Next steps and recommendations
- Legal disclaimer

#### 3. Build PDF Generator Service (1 hour)
**File**: `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts`

**Functions**:
- `generateTribunalReport(assessmentId)` - Main function
- `formatAssessmentData()` - Data serialization
- `embedEvidencePhotos()` - Image handling
- `calculateCompliance()` - Score calculation
- `generateFilename()` - Timestamp-based naming

#### 4. Add Download Button to UI (30 minutes)
**Location**: Assessment detail page (`/dashboard/repairing-standard/[id]`)

**UI Elements**:
- "Download Report" button (top right)
- Loading state during generation
- Success toast with download link
- Error handling

**Expected Output**:
```
tribunal-report-property-123-2025-10-03.pdf
```

## Afternoon Session (4 hours) - Certificate Integration

### Objective
Link certificates to assessment checkpoints and create unified compliance view.

### Tasks

#### 1. Certificate-Checkpoint Mapping (1 hour)
**File**: `src/lib/certificate-checkpoint-mapping.ts`

**Mapping Logic**:
```typescript
const CERTIFICATE_CHECKPOINT_MAP = {
  GAS_SAFETY: ['safe_services_gas'],
  EICR: ['safe_services_electrical'],
  EPC: ['heating_adequate', 'heating_controllable'],
  LEGIONELLA: ['safe_services_water'],
  PAT: ['safe_services_electrical']
}
```

**Functions**:
- `linkCertificatesToAssessment(assessmentId)` - Auto-link
- `getCertificateForCheckpoint(checkpointId)` - Get related cert
- `updateCheckpointFromCertificate(certificateId)` - Auto-populate status

#### 2. Auto-Populate Compliance (1.5 hours)
**Updates**: Repairing Standard router

**New Endpoint**: `syncCertificates`
```typescript
syncCertificates: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({ assessmentId: z.string() }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Get assessment with property
    // Find all valid certificates for property
    // Map certificates to checkpoints
    // Update checkpoint status to 'compliant' if cert valid
    // Update checkpoint status to 'non_compliant' if cert expired
    // Return updated assessment
  })
```

**Logic**:
- Gas Safety cert valid ‚Üí "Gas supply safe" = compliant
- Gas Safety cert expired ‚Üí "Gas supply safe" = non_compliant
- EICR valid ‚Üí "Electrical installations safe" = compliant
- EICR expired ‚Üí "Electrical installations safe" = non_compliant

#### 3. Certificate Warnings in Assessments (1 hour)
**Location**: Assessment wizard component

**UI Enhancements**:
- Warning badge if related certificate expired
- Link to certificate detail
- "Renew Certificate" button
- Expiry countdown (e.g., "Expires in 14 days")
- Visual indicator (icon + color)

**Example**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Related Certificate Expiring
Gas Safety Certificate expires in 7 days
[View Certificate] [Renew Now]
```

#### 4. Unified Compliance Dashboard (1.5 hours)
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/compliance/page.tsx`

**Layout**:

**Top Section - Overall Compliance Score**
- Large percentage badge
- Color-coded (green ‚â•80%, yellow 60-79%, red <60%)
- Breakdown by category

**Middle Section - Quick Stats**
- Total properties
- Compliant properties
- Properties with issues
- Certificates expiring soon

**Main Content - Property Cards**
Each property shows:
- Property address
- Overall compliance score
- Certificate status (5 types with expiry dates)
- Repairing Standard score
- HMO status (if applicable)
- Registration status
- Quick actions (View Details, Generate Report)

**Filters**:
- Compliance level (all, compliant, non-compliant, at-risk)
- Certificate type
- Location

**Expected Result**: Landlord sees ALL compliance data in one dashboard.
