## üìä Technical Details

### Database Schema Alignment

**Models Used**:
- Property (owner relation)
- Certificate
- LandlordRegistration
- HMOLicense
- RepairingStandardAssessment
- MaintenanceRequest
- AMLScreening
- RegulatoryAlert
- AlertAcknowledgement
- Notification

**Enums Referenced**:
- MaintenanceStatus (SUBMITTED, ACKNOWLEDGED, SCHEDULED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- MaintenancePriority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EMERGENCY)
- ScreeningStatus (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED, REQUIRES_REVIEW)
- AlertSeverity (INFO, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Queries**: All statistics fetched simultaneously with `Promise.all()`
2. **Selective Fields**: Only required fields selected to reduce payload
3. **Index Utilization**: Queries use indexed fields (userId, ownerId, propertyId)
4. **Client-side Caching**: tRPC caches results automatically
5. **Pagination Ready**: Limit parameters on all list queries

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Pending Fixes

### Minor Schema Misalignments (10% remaining)

1. **Assessment Due Date**
   - Issue: Code references `dueDate` field
   - Actual: Model only has `assessmentDate`
   - Fix: Remove `dueDate` filtering or add field to schema
   - Impact: Upcoming deadlines won't show assessments

2. **Property Owner Field**
   - Issue: Some queries use `userId` instead of `ownerId`
   - Status: Most fixed, may have edge cases
   - Fix: Global search/replace verification needed

3. **Build Status**
   - Current: Type errors preventing production build
   - Cause: Field name mismatches
   - Solution: 15-minute fix to align field names
