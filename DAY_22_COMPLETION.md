### Task 5: PWA Implementation ✅ (NEW - 100%)

**What We Built**:

#### 1. PWA Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "ScotComply - Scottish Landlord Compliance",
  "short_name": "ScotComply",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#2563eb",
  "icons": [8 sizes from 72x72 to 512x512],
  "shortcuts": [Dashboard, Properties, Certificates, Search]
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ App name and branding
- ✅ Standalone display mode
- ✅ Theme color customization
- ✅ Multiple icon sizes (72px - 512px)
- ✅ App shortcuts (quick actions)
- ✅ Maskable icons support
- ✅ Categories and metadata

#### 2. Service Worker (`public/sw.js`)
- **Lines**: ~140
- **Strategy**: Cache-first for static, network-first for API

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ Offline page caching
- ✅ Static asset caching
- ✅ Dynamic content caching
- ✅ API response caching
- ✅ Background sync support (ready)
- ✅ Push notifications support (ready)
- ✅ Cache versioning and cleanup
- ✅ Network fallback handling

**Caching Strategy**:
- **Static Files**: Cache immediately on install
- **API Requests**: Network-first, cache fallback
- **Pages**: Cache-first, network fallback
- **Offline**: Fallback to `/offline.html`

#### 3. Offline Fallback Page (`public/offline.html`)
- **Beautiful offline experience**
- ✅ Friendly messaging
- ✅ "Try Again" button
- ✅ Auto-reload when online
- ✅ Feature explanations
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Gradient background

#### 4. PWA Install Prompt (`src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`)
- **Auto-registers service worker**
- ✅ Handles install prompts
- ✅ Tracks installation status
- ✅ Client-side only (no SSR issues)
- ✅ localStorage for dismissed prompts

#### 5. Enhanced Metadata (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
```typescript
metadata = {
  manifest: '/manifest.json',
  themeColor: '#2563eb',
  viewport: { ... },
  appleWebApp: { ... },
  openGraph: { ... },
  twitter: { ... }
}
```

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ PWA manifest link
- ✅ Theme color meta tag
- ✅ Viewport configuration (mobile-optimized)
- ✅ Apple Web App support
- ✅ Format detection disabled (prevents auto-linking)
- ✅ Open Graph tags (social sharing)
- ✅ Twitter Card support
