## 🔄 In Progress

### File Storage Integration (Next Task)

**Current State:**
- Form is ready and functional
- File selection works
- Placeholder for S3 upload (line 144 in new/page.tsx)

**What's Needed:**
1. Choose storage provider (AWS S3 vs Cloudflare R2)
2. Set up bucket/container
3. Add upload utilities
4. Implement signed URLs for secure access
5. Update certificate creation to include documentUrl

**Recommendation: Cloudflare R2**
- ✅ S3-compatible API
- ✅ No egress fees (free downloads)
- ✅ Cheaper than AWS S3
- ✅ Better for Scottish/UK users (edge network)
- ✅ Easier setup

## 📊 Code Statistics

**Files Created Today:**
- `src/app/dashboard/certificates/new/page.tsx` - 350 lines
- `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx` - Generated by shadcn

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/certificates/page.tsx` - Added navigation links

**Total Lines Added:** ~380 lines

## 🎯 What Works Now

Users can now:
1. ✅ Navigate to Add Certificate page
2. ✅ Select a property from their portfolio
3. ✅ Choose certificate type
4. ✅ Enter issue date (auto-calculates expiry)
5. ✅ Provide inspector/provider details
6. ✅ Select a file for upload (validated)
7. ✅ Add optional notes
8. ✅ Submit the form (creates certificate in DB)

**Note:** File upload currently logs to console - S3 integration needed for actual storage.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Priority 1: File Storage (Today)
```bash
# Option A: Cloudflare R2 Setup
1. Create Cloudflare account
2. Create R2 bucket: scotcomply-certificates
3. Generate API token
4. Add to .env:
   - R2_ACCOUNT_ID
   - R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - R2_BUCKET_NAME

# Option B: AWS S3 Setup
1. Create S3 bucket
2. Configure CORS
3. Generate IAM credentials
4. Update .env (AWS_ variables already there)
```

### Priority 2: Upload Utilities
Create `src/lib/storage.ts`:
- Upload function
- Delete function
- Generate signed URLs
- File name sanitization

### Priority 3: Landlord Registration Module
After file storage is complete, build:
- Registration list page
- Add registration form
- Edit registration form
- Renewal tracking

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Form Validation Logic
```typescript
// Auto-expiry calculation
const issueDate = new Date('2025-10-02')
const certType = { validityYears: 1 } // Gas Safety
const expiryDate = new Date(issueDate)
expiryDate.setFullYear(expiryDate.getFullYear() + 1)
// Result: 2026-10-02
```

### File Upload Placeholder
```typescript
// Current (line 144):
let documentUrl = undefined
if (selectedFile) {
  console.log('File to upload:', selectedFile.name)
  documentUrl = undefined // Will be S3 URL
}

// Future:
if (selectedFile) {
  documentUrl = await uploadToStorage(selectedFile)
}
```
