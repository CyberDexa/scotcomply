Day 8 focused on building a comprehensive analytics dashboard to provide data-driven insights into compliance performance. Users can now visualize trends, track costs, assess risks, and export detailed reports for their property portfolios.

---

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Chart.js and Dependencies Installation
**Packages Installed:**
- `chart.js@^4.4.8` - Core charting library
- `react-chartjs-2@^5.3.0` - React wrapper for Chart.js
- `date-fns@^4.1.0` - Date manipulation and formatting
- `jspdf@^2.5.2` - PDF generation for reports

**Total Added:** 26 new packages (4 direct dependencies + 22 subdependencies)

---

### 2. Analytics tRPC Router
**File:** `src/server/routers/analytics.ts` (~450 lines)

**Endpoints Created:**

#### `getPortfolioStats` (Query)
Returns overview statistics:
```typescript
{
  totalProperties: number
  totalCertificates: number
  totalRegistrations: number
  totalHMOLicenses: number
  expiringCertificates: number  // 30-day window
  expiringRegistrations: number  // 60-day window
  expiringHMOLicenses: number    // 60-day window
  totalCompliance: number
  totalExpiring: number
}
```

#### `getComplianceTrends` (Query)
Tracks compliance items added over last 6 months:
```typescript
[{
  month: 'Oct 2025'
  certificates: number
  registrations: number
  hmoLicenses: number
  total: number
}]
```

**Logic:**
- Generates 6 months of data (current month back to 5 months ago)
- Groups by `createdAt` timestamp
- Counts certificates, registrations, and HMO licenses separately

#### `getCostSummary` (Query)
Comprehensive cost analysis:
```typescript
{
  totalCosts: number
  totalRegistrationFees: number
  totalHMOFees: number
  averageRegistrationFee: number
  averageHMOFee: number
  costsByCouncil: [{ council: string, cost: number }]
  monthlyBreakdown: [{
    month: string
    registrationCost: number
    hmoCost: number
    total: number
  }]
}
```

**Features:**
- Aggregates all registration renewal fees
- Aggregates all HMO annual fees
- Groups costs by council area
- Calculates monthly spending for last 6 months
- Computes averages for fee comparison

#### `getExpiryTimeline` (Query)
Next 90 days of upcoming expiries:
```typescript
[{
  id: string
  type: 'certificate' | 'registration' | 'hmo'
  title: string
  propertyAddress: string
  expiryDate: Date
  daysUntilExpiry: number
  status: string
}]
```

**Logic:**
- Queries certificates, registrations, and HMO licenses
- Filters by expiry date (now to +90 days)
- Combines and sorts by days until expiry (ascending)
- Calculates `daysUntilExpiry` using `differenceInDays()`

#### `getRiskAssessment` (Query)
Intelligent risk scoring system:
```typescript
{
  riskScore: number        // 0-100 (capped)
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  totalProperties: number
  riskFactors: [{
    factor: string
    count: number
    severity: 'critical' | 'high'
    points: number
  }]
  summary: {
    expiredCertificates: number
    expiredRegistrations: number
    expiredHMOLicenses: number
    expiringCertificates: number
    expiringRegistrations: number
    expiringHMOLicenses: number
    nonCompliantHMOs: number
  }
}
```

**Risk Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Critical Risk Factors (30 points each):
- Expired certificates (expiryDate < now)
- Expired registrations (expiryDate < now)
- Expired HMO licenses (expiryDate < now)

Critical Risk Factors (25 points each):
- Fire safety non-compliance (fireSafetyCompliant = false)

High Risk Factors (10 points each):
- Certificates expiring within 30 days
- Registrations expiring within 60 days
- HMO licenses expiring within 60 days

Risk Levels:
- Low: 0 points
- Medium: 1-25 points
- High: 26-50 points
- Critical: 51+ points (capped at 100)
```

**Why This Matters:**
Scottish landlords face severe penalties:
- **Expired certificates**: Cannot evict, prosecution, fines
- **Expired registrations**: £50,000 fines, cannot evict
- **Expired HMO licenses**: Criminal prosecution, closure orders
- **Fire safety non-compliance**: Immediate closure, prosecution

The risk score provides objective measurement of portfolio health.

#### `getCertificateBreakdown` (Query)
Distribution of certificate types:
```typescript
[{
  type: 'GAS SAFETY' | 'EPC' | 'EICR' | 'PAT'
  count: number
}]
```

**Database Operation:**
Uses Prisma `groupBy()` for efficient aggregation:
```typescript
await ctx.prisma.certificate.groupBy({
  by: ['certificateType'],
  where: { userId },
  _count: { certificateType: true }
})
```

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Chart.js Integration
**Client-Side Only:**
Chart.js requires browser APIs, so components use `'use client'` directive.

**Registration Pattern:**
```typescript
import { Chart as ChartJS, ...modules } from 'chart.js'

ChartJS.register(
  CategoryScale,
  LinearScale,
  ...
)
```

Only registers needed modules (tree-shaking).

### 2. Date Manipulation with date-fns
**Key Functions Used:**
- `startOfMonth()` - Get first day of month
- `endOfMonth()` - Get last day of month
- `subMonths()` - Subtract months from date
- `format()` - Format dates ('MMM yyyy', 'dd/MM/yyyy')
- `differenceInDays()` - Calculate days between dates

**Why date-fns over moment.js:**
- Smaller bundle size (tree-shakeable)
- Immutable by default
- Modern API
- Better TypeScript support

### 3. Prisma Aggregation
**groupBy Example:**
```typescript
const certificates = await ctx.prisma.certificate.groupBy({
  by: ['certificateType'],
  where: { userId },
  _count: { certificateType: true }
})
```

**Benefits:**
- Database-level aggregation (fast)
- Reduces data transfer
- Type-safe with Prisma types

### 4. Parallel Queries with Promise.all
**Pattern Used Throughout:**
```typescript
const [stats1, stats2, stats3] = await Promise.all([
  ctx.prisma.model1.count(...),
  ctx.prisma.model2.count(...),
  ctx.prisma.model3.count(...)
])
```

**Benefits:**
- Executes queries concurrently
- Reduces total query time
- Maintains type safety

### 5. Risk Scoring Algorithm
**Design Principles:**
- **Weighted by severity**: Expired > Expiring
- **Capped at 100**: Prevents score overflow
- **Actionable thresholds**: Clear risk levels
- **Transparent calculation**: Shows point breakdown

**Real-World Impact:**
A landlord with:
- 1 expired certificate (30 points) → **Medium Risk**
- 2 expired certificates (60 points) → **High Risk**
- 1 expired cert + fire safety issue (55 points) → **High Risk**
- 3 expired items + fire safety (115 → 100 points) → **Critical Risk**

### 6. Responsive Chart Design
**Fixed Height Strategy:**
```typescript
<div className="h-[300px]">
  <Line data={chartData} options={options} />
</div>
```

**Rationale:**
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Prevents layout shift
- Works across devices
- Chart.js handles responsive width

## Data Insights Examples

### Example Portfolio Statistics
```json
{
  "totalProperties": 12,
  "totalCertificates": 36,
  "totalRegistrations": 12,
  "totalHMOLicenses": 4,
  "totalCompliance": 52,
  "expiringCertificates": 5,
  "expiringRegistrations": 2,
  "expiringHMOLicenses": 1,
  "totalExpiring": 8
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- 12 properties managed
- Average 3 certificates per property (Gas, EPC, EICR)
- All properties registered
- 4 HMO properties (33% of portfolio)
- 8 items need attention (15% expiring soon)

### Example Risk Assessment
```json
{
  "riskScore": 40,
  "riskLevel": "high",
  "riskFactors": [
    {
      "factor": "Expired Certificates",
      "count": 1,
      "severity": "critical",
      "points": 30
    },
    {
      "factor": "Expiring Certificates (30 days)",
      "count": 1,
      "severity": "high",
      "points": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- High risk (40 points)
- 1 certificate already expired (urgent)
- 1 certificate expiring within 30 days
- Action needed: Renew expired certificate immediately

### Example Cost Summary
```json
{
  "totalCosts": 3250,
  "totalRegistrationFees": 1800,
  "totalHMOFees": 1450,
  "averageRegistrationFee": 150,
  "averageHMOFee": 362.50,
  "costsByCouncil": [
    { "council": "City of Edinburgh", "cost": 1200 },
    { "council": "Glasgow City", "cost": 950 },
    { "council": "Aberdeen City", "cost": 600 },
    { "council": "Dundee City", "cost": 500 }
  ]
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- £3,250 total compliance costs YTD
- Registration fees: £1,800 (55%)
- HMO fees: £1,450 (45%)
- Edinburgh most expensive (£1,200)
- Average HMO fee >2x registration fee

## Known Limitations

1. **Chart.js Bundle Size**: 208 KB for analytics page (acceptable trade-off for visualization)
2. **90-Day Timeline Limit**: Only shows next 90 days (could add "View All" option)
3. **Top 10 Councils in PDF**: Limited to prevent PDF overflow (CSV has all)
4. **No Chart Export**: Charts not included in PDF (could add Chart.js to PDF conversion)
5. **Static Time Ranges**: 6 months fixed (could add date range selector)
