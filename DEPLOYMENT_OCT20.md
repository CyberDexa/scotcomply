- ‚úÖ All static files generated
- ‚úÖ Serverless functions created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment encountered a transient Vercel error
- üîÑ Triggered fresh rebuild with empty commit

### What Happened

The build completed successfully (as shown by the build output), but Vercel encountered an unexpected error during the deployment phase. This is noted as a transient infrastructure issue on Vercel's end.

**Build Output Summary:**
```
Build Completed in /vercel/output [2m]
Deploying outputs...
‚ùå An unexpected error happened when running this build
```

This error occurred AFTER the build was successful, during the deployment phase.

### Resolution

**Action Taken:**
1. Created an empty commit to trigger a fresh deployment
2. Pushed to GitHub to start new build/deploy cycle
3. Vercel will now attempt deployment again

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor new deployment at: https://vercel.com/cyberdexa/scotcomply/deployments
2. If error persists, options include:
   - Wait 5-10 minutes and retry (transient errors usually resolve)
   - Contact Vercel support if it continues
   - Check Vercel status page: https://www.vercel-status.com/

### Production URLs

Once deployment succeeds:
- **Landing Page**: https://scotcomply.co.uk
- **Sign In**: https://scotcomply.co.uk/auth/signin
- **Sign Up**: https://scotcomply.co.uk/auth/signup
- **Dashboard**: https://scotcomply.co.uk/dashboard

### Local Testing

The app works perfectly on local development:
```bash
cd /Users/olaoluwabayomi/Desktop/ComplyScot/04_MY_PROJECTS/active/scottish-compliance-app
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

All branding enhancements are visible and working locally.

### Technical Details

**Build Stats:**
- Build time: ~2 minutes
- Total routes: 50+ pages
- Static pages: Landing, auth pages
- Dynamic pages: Dashboard pages
- Shared JS: 102 kB
- All pages < 200 kB first load

**Environment:**
- Next.js: 15.5.4
- Node.js: Latest (Vercel default)
- Prisma: 6.16.3
- Build command: `prisma generate && next build`

### Vercel Error Context

The error message states:
> "An unexpected error happened when running this build. We have been notified of the problem. This may be a transient error."

This indicates:
1. ‚úÖ Vercel's team has been automatically notified
2. ‚úÖ Error is likely temporary/infrastructure-related
3. ‚úÖ Not caused by code issues (build completed successfully)
4. ‚úÖ Retry should resolve the issue

### Status: üü° Pending

**Current:** Waiting for fresh deployment to complete
**ETA:** 2-3 minutes
**Confidence:** High (build succeeded, deployment error is transient)
