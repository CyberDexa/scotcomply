## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Potential Delays & Mitigations

**Risk**: Third-party API integration (ComplyAdvantage)  
**Impact**: 2-3 days delay  
**Mitigation**: Start API integration early (Day 26), have mock data ready

**Risk**: Database migrations issues  
**Impact**: 1-2 days delay  
**Mitigation**: Test migrations thoroughly, have rollback plan

**Risk**: Scope creep  
**Impact**: Significant delay  
**Mitigation**: Strict adherence to defined features, "nice-to-haves" post-launch

**Risk**: Bug fixing takes longer than expected  
**Impact**: 2-4 days delay  
**Mitigation**: Buffer time on Fridays, continuous testing

### Buffer Time
- Each Friday: 2-4 hours buffer
- Week 8: Extra 2 days for unforeseen issues
- Post-launch Week 9: Bug fixing week if needed
