# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX - Welcome Email Not Working

## The Problem

You're not receiving welcome emails because **`scotcomply.co.uk` is likely not verified in Resend**.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

Use Resend's test domain that works immediately:

### Step 1: Update EMAIL_FROM in Vercel

```bash
# Remove the current EMAIL_FROM
npx vercel env rm EMAIL_FROM production

# Add it back with Resend's test domain
npx vercel env add EMAIL_FROM production
```

When prompted, enter:
```
onboarding@resend.dev
```

### Step 2: Redeploy

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger redeploy for email fix"
git push
```

### Step 3: Test

Wait 2 minutes for deployment, then sign up with a new test account. You should receive the email immediately!

## üîç Why This Happens

Resend requires domain verification before you can send from `noreply@scotcomply.co.uk`. Until verified:
- Emails from your domain are rejected
- No error shown in basic logs
- Resend API returns error: "Domain not verified"

## üìä Permanent Fix - Verify Your Domain

### Option A: Use Resend Test Domain (Recommended for Now)

Keep using `onboarding@resend.dev` - it works perfectly and is meant for production use.

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- No DNS setup needed
- Professional enough for testing
- Free forever

**Cons:**
- Emails come from "resend.dev" instead of your domain
- Less branded

### Option B: Verify Your Own Domain (Do Later)

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `scotcomply.co.uk`
4. Add these DNS records in Cloudflare:

```
Type: TXT
Name: scotcomply.co.uk  
Value: [Resend will show you this - looks like: v=DKIM1;...]

Type: MX
Name: scotcomply.co.uk
Priority: 10
Value: [Resend will show you this]
```

5. Wait 5-10 minutes
6. Click "Verify" in Resend
7. Once verified, change EMAIL_FROM back to `noreply@scotcomply.co.uk`

## üéØ Do This Right Now

Copy and paste these commands:

```bash
# 1. Update EMAIL_FROM to test domain
npx vercel env rm EMAIL_FROM production
npx vercel env add EMAIL_FROM production
# Type: onboarding@resend.dev

# 2. Redeploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "use resend test domain for emails"
git push

# 3. Wait 2 minutes, then test signup at:
# https://scotcomply.co.uk/auth/signup
```

**Expected result**: Welcome email arrives within 30 seconds! ‚úÖ

## üî¨ Alternative: Check If Domain Is Verified

Go to https://resend.com/domains and check if `scotcomply.co.uk` appears in the list.

**If it's there:**
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark = Verified (email should work)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warning = Pending verification (add DNS records)
- ‚ùå Red X = Failed (check DNS records)

**If it's not there:**
- Domain was never added
- Use test domain or add your domain

## üìù Summary

**Problem**: Domain not verified  
**Quick Fix**: Use `onboarding@resend.dev`  
**Time to Fix**: 2 minutes  
**Permanent Fix**: Verify domain (do later)
