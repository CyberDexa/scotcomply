# Cloudflare R2 Integration - Completion Report

**Date:** 2 October 2025  
**Phase:** Day 3 - File Storage Integration  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### 1. ‚úÖ AWS SDK Installation
- Installed `@aws-sdk/client-s3` (S3-compatible client for R2)
- Installed `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` (secure URL generation)
- Added 104 packages, 0 vulnerabilities

### 2. ‚úÖ Environment Configuration
**Updated Files:**
- `.env` - Added R2 credentials configuration
- `src/lib/env.ts` - Added R2 environment variable validation

**New Environment Variables:**
```bash
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=""          # Cloudflare account ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""       # R2 API token access key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""   # R2 API token secret
R2_BUCKET_NAME="scotcomply-documents"
R2_PUBLIC_URL=""          # Optional public bucket URL
```

### 3. ‚úÖ File Storage Implementation
**File:** `src/lib/storage.ts` (~150 lines)

**Functions Implemented:**

#### `uploadFile(file, folder)`
- Uploads files to Cloudflare R2
- Converts File to Buffer for upload
- Sets correct Content-Type and Content-Length
- Sanitizes filenames for security
- Returns file key for database storage
- **Fallback:** Works in development mode without R2 credentials

#### `deleteFile(fileUrl)`
- Deletes files from R2 bucket
- Extracts key from URL automatically
- Handles both URL and key formats
- **Fallback:** Simulates deletion in development mode

#### `getSignedUrl(fileUrl, expiresIn)`
- Generates secure, time-limited URLs (default: 1 hour)
- Uses AWS S3 presigned URL mechanism
- Enables private bucket with secure access
- **Fallback:** Returns original URL in development mode

#### Additional Utilities:
- `validateFile()` - Pre-upload validation (size, type)
- `sanitizeFileName()` - Security against path traversal
- `fileToBase64()` - Convert files for previews
- `formatFileSize()` - Human-readable display

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ S3-compatible API (works with Cloudflare R2)
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback for development
- ‚úÖ Type-safe with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Secure by default (private bucket + signed URLs)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging

### 4. ‚úÖ Certificate Detail Page
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/certificates/[id]/page.tsx` (~370 lines)

**Features:**
- View certificate details with full information
- Property information card
- Certificate dates and expiry tracking
- Provider contact details
- Document download with signed URLs
- Delete certificate with confirmation
- Status badges (valid/expiring/expired)
- Days until expiry calculation
- Alert cards for expiring/expired certificates
- Link to upload renewed certificate
- Responsive layout with cards

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ User authentication required
- ‚úÖ Ownership verification (users only see their certificates)
- ‚úÖ Signed URLs for file downloads
- ‚úÖ Delete confirmation dialog

### 5. ‚úÖ Build Verification
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Build successful
- **Routes:** 14 total (was 13, added certificate detail page)
- **Bundle Size:** 102 KB (excellent performance)
- **Errors:** 0 TypeScript errors
- **Linting:** All ESLint warnings fixed

**New Route:**
```
‚îú ∆í /dashboard/certificates/[id]  4.35 kB  145 kB
```

## üìä Technical Details

### R2 Client Configuration
```typescript
const r2Client = env.R2_ACCOUNT_ID && env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID && env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  ? new S3Client({
      region: 'auto',
      endpoint: `https://${env.R2_ACCOUNT_ID}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`,
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        secretAccessKey: env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
      },
    })
  : null
```

### Upload Flow
```typescript
// Convert File to Buffer
const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer()
const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)

// Upload to R2
await r2Client.send(
  new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: `certificates/${timestamp}-${sanitizedName}`,
    Body: buffer,
    ContentType: file.type,
    ContentLength: file.size,
  })
)
```

### Signed URL Generation
```typescript
const command = new GetObjectCommand({
  Bucket: env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,
  Key: key,
})

const signedUrl = await getS3SignedUrl(r2Client, command, { 
  expiresIn: 3600  // 1 hour
})
```

## üîí Security Features

### File Storage
- ‚úÖ **Private by default** - Bucket not publicly accessible
- ‚úÖ **Signed URLs** - Time-limited access (1 hour expiry)
- ‚úÖ **File validation** - Type and size checks before upload
- ‚úÖ **Filename sanitization** - Removes special characters, prevents path traversal
- ‚úÖ **User authentication** - All operations require login

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ **Ownership verification** - Users only access their own certificates
- ‚úÖ **Property ownership check** - Certificate linked to user-owned properties
- ‚úÖ **tRPC protected procedures** - All endpoints require authentication

### File Validation Rules
```typescript
{
  maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,  // 10MB
  allowedTypes: [
    'application/pdf',
    'image/jpeg',
    'image/jpg',
    'image/png'
  ]
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### Cloudflare R2 Free Tier
- **Storage:** 10 GB/month (FREE)
- **Class A Operations:** 1 million/month (uploads, lists) (FREE)
- **Class B Operations:** 10 million/month (downloads) (FREE)
- **Egress:** Unlimited (FREE) - **This is the big advantage!**

### Expected Usage for ScotComply
- **Properties:** 100-500
- **Certificates:** 500-2,500
- **Storage:** ~1-2 GB (PDFs + images)
- **Operations:** ~1,000 uploads/month, ~5,000 downloads/month
- **Estimated Cost:** **$0/month** (well within free tier)

### Comparison vs AWS S3
- **AWS S3 Storage:** $0.023/GB = $0.50/month for 20GB
- **AWS S3 Egress:** $0.09/GB = **$9.00/month** for 100GB downloads
- **Cloudflare R2:** $0.015/GB storage + **$0 egress** = **$0.30/month**
- **Savings:** ~$9.20/month (~96% cheaper for download-heavy workloads)

```bash
# .env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID="abc123..."
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="xyz789..."
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secretkey..."
R2_BUCKET_NAME="scotcomply-documents"
```

**Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Files uploaded to cloud storage
- ‚úÖ Persistent file storage
- ‚úÖ Signed URLs for secure access
- ‚úÖ File deletion from cloud
- ‚úÖ Production-ready

**Best For:**
