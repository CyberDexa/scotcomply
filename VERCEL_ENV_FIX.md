# üö® VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FIX

## Problem
The build is failing because **3 required environment variables** are missing or invalid:

1. ‚ùå `DATABASE_URL` - Invalid URL (not being read from Vercel)
2. ‚ùå `EMAIL_FROM` - Missing (required)
3. ‚ùå `APP_URL` - Missing (required)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Add These Environment Variables to Vercel

**Go to:** https://vercel.com/cyberdexas-projects/scottish-compliance-app/settings/environment-variables

### Required Variables (Add ALL of these):

#### 1. DATABASE_URL (Production)
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_IGYtlwJKrc21@ep-polished-cell-adnqx7d8-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```
**Environment:** Production

---

#### 2. NEXTAUTH_SECRET (Production)
```
mMOTOqVzoB9sHbDXo6duqQ3rT+a9nGJ05HISSIcV2R0=
```
**Environment:** Production

---

#### 3. NEXTAUTH_URL (Production)
```
https://scotcomply.co.uk
```
**Environment:** Production
**Note:** Using custom domain (or use Vercel URL temporarily until domain is set up)

---

#### 4. EMAIL_FROM (Production) - NEW ‚ú®
```
noreply@scotcomply.co.uk
```
**Environment:** Production
**Note:** This can be any email. It's used as the sender address.

---

#### 5. APP_URL (Production) - NEW ‚ú®
```
https://scotcomply.co.uk
```
**Environment:** Production
**Note:** Same as NEXTAUTH_URL (your custom domain)

---

#### 6. NODE_ENV (Production) - NEW ‚ú®
```
production
```
**Environment:** Production

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard:**
   https://vercel.com/cyberdexas-projects/scottish-compliance-app/settings/environment-variables

2. **For EACH variable above:**
   - Click "Add New" button
   - Enter the variable name (e.g., `EMAIL_FROM`)
   - Enter the value (e.g., `noreply@scotcomply.com`)
   - Select **Production** environment
   - Click "Save"

3. **After adding ALL 6 variables**, redeploy:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/olaoluwabayomi/Desktop/ComplyScot/04_MY_PROJECTS/active/scottish-compliance-app
   npx vercel --prod --yes
   ```

---

### Method 2: Using Vercel CLI (If you prefer terminal)

```bash
cd /Users/olaoluwabayomi/Desktop/ComplyScot/04_MY_PROJECTS/active/scottish-compliance-app

# Add each variable
npx vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
# Then paste: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_IGYtlwJKrc21@ep-polished-cell-adnqx7d8-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

npx vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET production
# Then paste: mMOTOqVzoB9sHbDXo6duqQ3rT+a9nGJ05HISSIcV2R0=

npx vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL production
# Then paste: https://scottish-compliance-4gnrlld19-cyberdexas-projects.vercel.app

npx vercel env add EMAIL_FROM production
# Then paste: noreply@scotcomply.com

npx vercel env add APP_URL production
# Then paste: https://scottish-compliance-4gnrlld19-cyberdexas-projects.vercel.app

npx vercel env add NODE_ENV production
# Then paste: production

# Redeploy
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist

After adding variables, verify:
- [ ] All 6 variables added to Production environment
- [ ] No typos in variable names (case-sensitive!)
- [ ] DATABASE_URL includes `?sslmode=require` at the end
- [ ] EMAIL_FROM is a valid email format
- [ ] APP_URL and NEXTAUTH_URL are the same
- [ ] Redeployed after adding variables

---

## üîç How to Verify Variables Were Added

```bash
# List all production environment variables
npx vercel env ls production
```

You should see:
- DATABASE_URL
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET  
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- EMAIL_FROM (new)
- APP_URL (new)
- NODE_ENV (new)

---

## üöÄ After Adding Variables

1. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod --yes
   ```

2. **Wait for build to complete** (~2-3 minutes)

3. **Test signup:**
   https://scottish-compliance-4gnrlld19-cyberdexas-projects.vercel.app/auth/signup

4. **If successful**, you'll be able to create an account! üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Happened

The `.vercelignore` file prevents `.env` from being deployed, which is correct for security. However, Vercel needs environment variables to be explicitly set in the dashboard/CLI. They were missing because:

1. We added `DATABASE_URL` but didn't verify others
2. `EMAIL_FROM` and `APP_URL` are validated as required in `src/lib/env.ts`
3. Next.js loads environment variables from Vercel's system, not from `.env` files

---

## üìû Need Help?

If you still get errors after adding these variables:

1. Double-check variable names (exact case)
2. Ensure they're set for "Production" environment
3. Try redeploying with `npx vercel --prod --yes --force`
4. Check the Vercel deployment logs for specific error messages
