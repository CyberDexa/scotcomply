## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **`src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx`** (Updated)
   - React Email component for the welcome message
   - Props: `name` (user's name), `dashboardUrl` (link to dashboard)
   - Styled with inline CSS for email compatibility

2. **`src/server/routers/user.ts`** (Modified)
   - Added email sending to the `register` mutation
   - Sends email asynchronously (non-blocking)
   - Uses error handling to prevent registration failure if email fails

### How It Works:

```typescript
// In user.ts register mutation (after user creation):
sendEmail({
  to: user.email,
  subject: 'Welcome to ScotComply - Your Scottish Compliance Platform',
  react: WelcomeEmail({
    name: user.name,
    dashboardUrl: `${env.APP_URL}/dashboard`,
  }),
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Failed to send welcome email to:', user.email, error)
  // Don't throw - we don't want email failures to block registration
})
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Async/Non-Blocking**: Email sends asynchronously so registration completes immediately
2. **Error Handling**: Email failures are logged but don't prevent user registration
3. **Environment-Based URL**: Dashboard URL uses `APP_URL` from environment variables
4. **React Email**: Uses React Email for better email template development experience

## üß™ Testing

### Development Testing:

If you don't have `RESEND_API_KEY` configured, the email will log to console instead:

```
üìß [Email Preview - Resend Not Configured]
To: user@example.com
Subject: Welcome to ScotComply - Your Scottish Compliance Platform
HTML: <html>...
---
```

### Production Testing:

1. Create a new user account at https://scotcomply.co.uk/auth/signup
2. Check the email inbox for the registered email address
3. Verify the email contains all 8 features and 5 quick start steps
4. Test the "Go to Your Dashboard" button

### Preview Email Locally:

You can add a preview route to see the email in the browser:

```typescript
// Create: src/app/api/email/preview/route.tsx
import { render } from '@react-email/render'
import WelcomeEmail from '@/emails/WelcomeEmail'

export async function GET() {
  const html = render(WelcomeEmail({
    name: 'Test User',
    dashboardUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/dashboard',
  }))
  
  return new Response(html, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' },
  })
}
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/email/preview`

## üìù Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` or Vercel environment:

```env
# Email sending (Resend.com)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Sender email (must be verified domain with Resend)
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@scotcomply.co.uk

# Application URL (for dashboard link)
APP_URL=https://scotcomply.co.uk
```

## üöÄ Deployment

**Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed to Production

- **Commit**: `1833f09` - "feat: add onboarding welcome email with app feature guide"
- **Deployment**: `scottish-compliance-9l8f7oee2` (‚óè Ready - 2m build time)
- **Production URL**: https://scotcomply.co.uk

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Email Delivery:

1. **Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/emails
   - View sent emails
   - Check delivery status
   - See open/click rates

2. **Application Logs**: Check Vercel logs for:
   ```
   Failed to send welcome email to: [email] [error]
   ```

3. **User Feedback**: Monitor support requests about missing welcome emails

## üé® Customization

### To Update Email Content:

Edit `src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx`:

```tsx
// Add/remove features
<Text style={feature}>
  ‚ú® <strong>New Feature</strong> - Description here
</Text>

// Modify quick start steps
<Text style={listItem}>
  6. <strong>New Step</strong> - Instructions here
</Text>
```

### To Change Styling:

Modify the style objects at the bottom of `WelcomeEmail.tsx`:

```tsx
const button = {
  backgroundColor: '#4F46E5', // Change color
  borderRadius: '8px',
  fontSize: '16px',
  // ... more styles
}
```

### To Add More Email Types:

1. Create new email template in `src/emails/`
2. Import and use in relevant router
3. Add to email service types if needed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check RESEND_API_KEY**: Verify it's set in Vercel environment
2. **Check EMAIL_FROM**: Must be a verified domain in Resend
3. **Check Logs**: Look for "Failed to send welcome email" errors
4. **Test Resend API**: Use Resend dashboard to send test email

### Email Goes to Spam?

1. **Verify Domain**: Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records for your sending domain
2. **Check Content**: Avoid spam trigger words
3. **Test Spam Score**: Use mail-tester.com

### Styling Issues?

1. **Inline CSS Only**: Email clients don't support `<style>` tags well
2. **Test Across Clients**: Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail all render differently
3. **Use Email Testing Tools**: Litmus or Email on Acid
