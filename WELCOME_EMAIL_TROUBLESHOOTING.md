# Welcome Email Not Sending - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Issue
You signed up for a new account but didn't receive the welcome email.

## ✅ What We've Done

### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging
I've added detailed logging throughout the email sending process. When you sign up now, the Vercel logs will show:

```
📧 Attempting to send welcome email to: user@example.com
📧 User name: John Doe
📧 Dashboard URL: https://scotcomply.co.uk/dashboard
📧 sendEmail called with: { to: 'user@example.com', subject: '...', hasReact: true }
📧 Resend client configured: true
📧 EMAIL_FROM: noreply@scotcomply.co.uk
📧 Calling resend.emails.send...
📧 Resend API Response: { ... }
✅ Email sent successfully! ID: abc123
```

Or if there's an error:
```
❌ Failed to send welcome email to: user@example.com
📧 Resend returned an error: { message: "...", name: "..." }
```

### 2. Environment Variables Status
Both required variables are configured in Vercel:
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` - Already set
- ✅ `EMAIL_FROM` - Already set to `noreply@scotcomply.co.uk`

## 🔬 Next Steps to Debug

### Step 1: Check Vercel Logs (MOST IMPORTANT)

After signing up, immediately check the logs:

```bash
npx vercel logs --follow
```

Or check in Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/cyberdexas-projects/scottish-compliance-app
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "Runtime Logs" tab
4. Look for messages starting with 📧

**What to look for:**
- Is the welcome email function being called?
- Does it say "Resend client configured: true" or "false"?
- What does the "Resend API Response" show?
- Any error messages?

### Step 2: Verify Resend Domain

The sender email is `noreply@scotcomply.co.uk`. You MUST verify this domain in Resend:

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Check if `scotcomply.co.uk` is listed
3. If not, click "Add Domain" and add it
4. If yes, check the status:
   - ✅ **Green checkmark** = Verified (good!)
   - ⚠️ **Yellow warning** = Pending verification
   - ❌ **Red X** = Failed verification

**If domain is not verified:**
1. Add these DNS records to your domain (in Cloudflare/your DNS provider):

```
Type: TXT
Name: scotcomply.co.uk
Value: [Resend will provide this]

Type: MX
Name: scotcomply.co.uk
Priority: 10
Value: [Resend will provide this]
```

2. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
3. Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard

**Alternative for Testing:**
Use Resend's test domain temporarily:
1. Change `EMAIL_FROM` in Vercel to: `onboarding@resend.dev`
2. This will work immediately for testing
3. Then add your custom domain later

### Step 3: Check Resend Dashboard

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. Look for emails sent to your test email address
3. Check the status:
   - **Sent** ✅ - Email was sent (check spam folder)
   - **Delivered** ✅✅ - Email was delivered
   - **Bounced** ❌ - Email address invalid or rejected
   - **Failed** ❌ - Error in sending

### Step 4: Check Spam Folder

The email might be going to spam because:
- Domain not fully verified
- First email from new domain
- No SPF/DKIM/DMARC records

**Check:**
1. Gmail spam folder
2. Outlook junk folder
3. Any email filtering rules

### Step 5: Test with a Different Email

Try signing up with:
- Gmail address
- Outlook/Hotmail address
- Your personal email

Sometimes corporate email servers block emails from new domains.

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Use Resend Test Domain (Immediate)

```bash
# In Vercel dashboard or CLI:
npx vercel env rm EMAIL_FROM production
npx vercel env add EMAIL_FROM production
# Enter: onboarding@resend.dev
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger redeploy"
git push
```

### Fix 2: Verify Your Domain (Permanent Solution)

1. Go to Resend dashboard
2. Add `scotcomply.co.uk` as a domain
3. Add the DNS records they provide
4. Wait for verification
5. Email FROM address will then work

### Fix 3: Check API Key

Verify the Resend API key is correct:

```bash
# Test the API key directly
curl https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer re_KcD5Cmdz_DSFeJMbPp9ePwJGtzjjaVvwp" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "onboarding@resend.dev",
    "to": "your-email@example.com",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "html": "<p>This is a test</p>"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "id": "abc123...",
  "from": "onboarding@resend.dev",
  "to": "your-email@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-01-04T..."
}
```

If you get an error, the API key might be invalid.

## 📊 What the Logs Will Tell Us

### Scenario 1: Domain Not Verified
```
📧 Resend API Response: {
  "error": {
    "message": "Domain scotcomply.co.uk is not verified",
    "name": "validation_error"
  }
}
```
**Fix:** Verify domain in Resend or use `onboarding@resend.dev`

### Scenario 2: API Key Invalid
```
📧 Resend API Response: {
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "name": "authentication_error"
  }
}
```
**Fix:** Update RESEND_API_KEY in Vercel

### Scenario 3: Success
```
📧 Resend API Response: {
  "data": {
    "id": "abc123-def456-..."
  }
}
✅ Email sent successfully to: user@example.com Email ID: abc123-def456-...
```
**Fix:** Check spam folder, email was sent!
