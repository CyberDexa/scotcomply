## 💭 Notes & Reflections

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Full Application**: Chose to build complete integrated product, not MVP
2. **8-Week Timeline**: Ambitious but achievable with AI assistance
3. **Three Phases**: Logical progression from core → advanced → intelligence
4. **Tech Stack**: Modern, scalable, well-supported technologies

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Buffer Time**: Built into each Friday
2. **Iterative Testing**: Test as we build, not at the end
3. **AI Automation**: ~70% code generation for speed
4. **Clear Documentation**: Everything documented upfront
